CONTACTING US:

Trying to reach CatAstro? Excellent decision, brave traveler.

Due to a recent incident involving a quantum entanglement experiment, a teleporting screwdriver, and an extremely judgmental black hole, there may be **delays** in communication. Messages occasionally vanish into the void or get rerouted through alternate dimensions where the keyboards have 97 keys and no escape button.

But worry not â€” we have backups.

BEST OPTIONS:
- Use the siteâ€™s contact form (currently fortified against spam bots and interdimensional raccoons)
- Email help@igboto.com â€” monitored by CatAstroâ€™s loyal robotic assistant, who has only crashed the inbox twice this week

Please note:
- CatAstro is currently off-world on a reconnaissance mission (something about â€œVenusian machine spiritsâ€), so replies may be slightly delayed due to solar flare interference and mandatory nap rotations.

CONTACT ETIQUETTE:
- Be kind, be curious, and donâ€™t send attachments with more entropy than your average wormhole.
- Support questions, blog inquiries, cosmic fan mail, or ideas for collaboration are all welcome.
- Messages are answered in the order received, unless they contain tuna â€” those go straight to the top.

Expect a reply as soon as possibleâ€¦ or whenever the gravity storm clears.

â€” CatAstro
