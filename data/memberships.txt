MEMBERSHIPS:

Congratulations, Earthling. Youâ€™re one paw-step away from joining CatAstroâ€™s Inner Circle of Slightly Unstable Genius.

Membership is completely FREE â€” no credit cards, no DNA samples, no weird rituals under a blood moon (unless youâ€™re into that).

By becoming a member, you gain access to:
- Exclusive downloads (tools, guides, schematics, maybe a cursed firmware update or two)
- The ability to comment on blog posts (CatAstro may or may not reply with purring or sarcasm)
- Occasional member-only experiments, beta tools, or spontaneous interstellar livestreams

PRIVACY POLICY:
CatAstro takes your privacy more seriously than he takes the Prime Directive.
- Your data is **never sold**, traded, or fed to AI training models without consent.
- You will only receive emails if you explicitly ask for updates or offer tribute in the form of tuna.

NO STRINGS, JUST LASERS:
There are no hidden fees, no upsells, and no â€œlimited time offers.â€ Just the sweet scent of digital freedom and the chance to hang out in a space-themed tech haven run by a slightly unhinged cat with a soldering iron.

SIGN-UP REQUIREMENTS:
- Valid email
- A willingness to tolerate puns, experiments, and the occasional zero-gravity hairball

Welcome aboard, member of the CatStronaut Collective.
